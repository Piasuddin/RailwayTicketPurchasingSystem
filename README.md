# RailwayTicketPurchasingSystem
# About
This is my personal web application project written in C# with ASP.NET MVC. I have created this application to control the flow of chaos ticket purchasing system in a 
railway station. This application can control the whole ticket purchasing system, the ticket master as well as the passenger very securely. 
There is no way to be dishonest. If this application is used by a station then to buy a ticket a passenger must to have a national id-card and 
through his/her national id-card first he/she needs to create a token. And later this token help him/her to purchase a ticket. It is impossible to 
purchase a ticket without creating a token. A person can purchase maximum six tickets in a day. If you need to know about available ticket there is 
no need to wait and ask the ticket master about availability of ticket. On the display you can see sold ticket number, pending ticket number and available ticket number.  
I think this application is enough to suppress all the corruption on the tickets of the railway.
